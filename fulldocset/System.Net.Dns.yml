  remarks: "The Dns class is a static class that retrieves information about a specific host from the Internet Domain Name System (DNS).  \n  \n The host information from the DNS query is returned in an instance of the <xref:System.Net.IPHostEntry> class. If the specified host has more than one entry in the DNS database, <xref:System.Net.IPHostEntry> contains multiple IP addresses and aliases."
  example:
  - "The following example queries the DNS database for information on the host www.contoso.com.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[Classic Dns Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/CPP/t-system.net.dns_1.cpp)]\n [!code-vb[Classic Dns Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/VisualBasic/t-system.net.dns_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[Classic Dns Example#1](~/add/codesnippet/CSharp/t-system.net.dns_1.cs)]"

This exception can also be returned if the name is not an official host name or alias, or it cannot be found in the database(s) being queried.  \n  \n The <xref:System.ArgumentException> exception is also returned if the `hostNameOrAddress` parameter contains <xref:System.Net.IPAddress.Any> or <xref:System.Net.IPAddress.IPv6Any>.  \n  \n The GetHostEntry method assumes that if an IP literal string is passed in the `hostNameOrAddress` parameter that the application wants an <xref:System.Net.IPHostEntry> instance returned with all of the properties set.

But it is possible for a stale DNS record for an IPv4 address that actually belongs to a different host to be returned. This may cause step #3 to fail and throw an exception (there is a DNS PTR record for the IPv4 address, but no DNS A record for the IPv4 address).  \n  \n For IPv6, step #2 above may fail, since most IPv6 deployments do not register the reverse (PTR) record for an IPv6 address.
